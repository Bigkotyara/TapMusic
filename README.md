# TapMusic
COGS 120 - Interaction Design Project

### Point of View:
Satisfying a music craving should be a few seconds away, saving you time and energy. The experience should be about enjoying music and achieving your goals, rather than looking for the next appropriate song.

### User Base:
TapMusic is a mobile web application for busy people who want quick, setting-appropriate music and do not have time to create playlists. This includes people who frequently use a phone while music is already playing.

### Core Interaction:
When the application is opened, users are greeted with a diverse selection of algorithmically created playlists based on song characteristics and lyrics. Additionally, the playlists may be either mood or activity-based. Once the appropriate playlist is selected, music satisfying the user's requirements for a given mood/activity will play instantly.
