# TapMusic
COGS 120 Project

### Point of View:
Satisfying a music craving should be a few seconds away. The process should be about listening to music rather than looking for the next appropriate song. It should take a few seconds to save you time and energy for achieving your goals.

### User Base:
Our application is targeted towards people who want music on the go and do not have time to create playlists and frequently use a phone while music is already playing.

### Core Interaction:
When the application is opened, the user will be greeted with a wide selection of algorithmically created playlists based on songs characteristics and lyrics. There are two types of playlists, mood type, and activity type. Once the appropriate playlist is selected, the music satisfying specific requirements for a given mood/activity will start playing immediately.
